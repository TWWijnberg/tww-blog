Optimistic and inquisitive analytical consultant, driven by results and purposeful work. I get excited by collaborating with colleagues with different skill sets to give advice on complex challenges. The last two years, I've supported 6 public sector clients in their digital transformation by defining and setting up analytics capabilities. I mostly do that using my experience in the fields of data science, behavioural science, and econometrics.\

In addition to working on important problems, I make impact by donating my income. I have pledged to donate at least 10% of my income to the world's most effective charities. Get in touch with me, or visit givingwhatwecan.org if you would like to learn more.

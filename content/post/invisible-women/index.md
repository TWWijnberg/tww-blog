I just finished reading Invisible Women by Caroline Criado Pérez (<https://lnkd.in/gNipqCU>). A great book to learn more about inequality, and the lack of data collection and usage. I specifically encourage all my male connections to give it a read. In addition to learning more about some of the biggest injustices for women, you will also learn about how society as a whole will benefit when we design our society to promote equality.\
\
For example, chapter 9 of the book describes the lack of innovation for products and services that mainly benefit women. Due to a data gap on breast milking in 2013, an innovative breast pump (like the one from [Elvie.com](http://elvie.com/)) struggled to get capital from almost exclusively male venture capitalists, although the alternative was an expensive, painful, slow, and inconvenient device. A $700M USD market of poorly served women. Other great case studies include the impact of paternity leave, quotas for influential positions, and urban design that alleviates unpaid work.
